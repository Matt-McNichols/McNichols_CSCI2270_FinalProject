For my final project I plan on making a task manager.  This will be a program 
that allows the user to organize their lives by creating a to do list.  The 
program will save all the items in the list and give options for how the list 
can be displayed. 

I plan on creating a struct called Item which contains a string for the item 
title, a due date for the item, a bool value for if the item has been completed,
and also an integer value for the priority level of item. 

I also plan on creating a class called TaskManager which will allow the user to
add items to their task manager as well as delete items or change an items 
completed value.  Also there will be multiple print functions which organize the
items either alphabetically, by due date, or by priority. these print functions
will only print items that have not been completed. There will also be an option
to print all the items in the task manager along with an indicator showing which
items have been completed and which have not.
